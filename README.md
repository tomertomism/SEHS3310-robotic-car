## Please have a look if you are taking SEHS3310 as well.
- First, Yes, my code can do the task smoothly. Try It.
* But PLEASE! Write your own codes, this program should not be your final product, you may fail this course if you are demostrating your robotic car with my codes.
* I gave my codes to my lecturer.
+ Tasks are not difficult, try to solve it in a simple way.
- This is my friendly reminder for you, good luck!

##Introduction
+ I am not using Arduino Uno/Mega in this project. Thoughout the section, I am using ARM MCU.
* Programme in the OpenMV folder is only applicable for OV5640 sensor.
* Finish time: 41s
* Bugs exist in some circumstances

* The only two files you may able to direct copy: [my_vl53l0x.c](https://github.com/tomertomism/SEHS3310-robotic-car/blob/main/ARM-Code-git/my_vl53l0x.c) and [my_vl53l0x.h](https://github.com/tomertomism/SEHS3310-robotic-car/blob/main/ARM-Code-git/my_vl53l0x.h).

* 咪抄code，ching。阿sir有晒我code。我唔想你fail嘅，你淨抄coding style都夠你fail。自己做，真係唔難，試下唔好將tasks複雜化。Step by Step做。
